### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm <a href="https://gocanto.dev/">Gus!</a> I'm a full-stack Software Engineer who has been building web technologies for more than a decade.

I like to work in environments where my critical and analytical thinking, entrepreneurial mindset, and passion for my work will contribute to a team.


I am also a [Golang](https://github.com/voyago) enthusiast :runner:.
