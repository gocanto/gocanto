### About Me 
I am a dedicated <a href="https://gocanto.dev/">engineering leader</a> passionate about building seamless, high-quality experiences for organizations and open source. With over fifteen years of experience in software development, workplace technology, and infrastructure management, I specialize in Golang, Node.js, and PHP. I am proficient in Laravel, Symfony, and modern web frameworks like Next.Js. I have led teams designing and implementing scalable, high-performance systems, ensuring reliability and efficiency across complex technical environments. 

Beyond technical expertise, I have a strong leadership background in managing cross-functional teams, optimizing workflows, and implementing best practices that drive productivity and innovation. I thrive in fast-paced environments that demand strategic thinking, problem-solving, and a commitment to delivering high-quality results. 

I have worked closely with financial services companies, delivering secure and compliant solutions that align with industry regulations. I understand financial institutions' technical and operational demands and have implemented robust architectures that support high-availability systems, data security, and transactional integrity. 

In addition to my software engineering and leadership experience, I have extensive expertise in workplace technology and IT infrastructure management. I have overseen cloud infrastructure, on-premises network administration, and enterprise IT solutions, ensuring secure, scalable, and efficient operations. My knowledge extends to user management, security policies, and system integration, making me well-versed in enterprise collaboration tools. 

I am well-versed in network protocols, including DHCP, TCP/IP, and VPN configurations, ensuring seamless connectivity and system security across distributed teams and cloud-based infrastructures. My expertise in managing networking challenges and experience in cloud services and workplace technology allow me to contribute effectively to IT operations and digital transformation initiatives. 

I constantly seek <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gocanto/">opportunities</a> to enhance technology-driven processes, improve operational efficiency, and empower teams with the tools and strategies to succeed.
