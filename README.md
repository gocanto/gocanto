### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gus! I'm a full-stack web developer who has building web technologies for more than a decade.

I like to work in environments where my critical and analytical thinking, entrepreneurial mindset, and passion for my work will contribute to a team and sharpen my skills.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `golang`!
